#TicTacToeNow

[TicTacToeNow](/swvist/TicTacToeNow/) is the classic game of Tic Tac Toe with real time awesomeness powered by wesockets. It does not work now and will not work anytime soon. Currently all I have is a bunch of javascript files that does what it is supposed to do, atleast in the chrome console. The UI is backbone powered. Anything not that or similar would have been stupid. The backend will be Erlang/Yaws.
